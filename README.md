# SoC-2k22
Summer of code : Project on Loan Approval and Prediction

**"**FILES**" file contains the info to all the files created for the project.**

# Resources
Mostly used websites such as **geeksforgeeks** (for understanding different syntax/functions of python for different libraries involved), some **Youtube tutorials** for learning python in early weeks of the course, **kapple** for working on different data files and for several methods of data cleaning and processing.

# WEEK-1: 30 April - 5 May
Learned basic python syntax and functions, mostly learned how to apply different algorithms and functions of python. 
Learned about some interfaces such as **Google Colab** and **jupyter notebook.**
**Assignment** based upon the concepts learned in the week.

# WEEK-2: 14 May - 20 May
Learned about different python libraries such as **numpy, pandas, matplotlib** (although not completely since they are very vast :D ).
Some insight into **mathematics used for ML.**
**Assignment** based upon the concepts learned iin the week.

# WEEK-3: 6 July - 12 July
Learning basic machine learning ideas and different data science algorithms.
Brief intro to different algorithms such as **Linear regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees.**

# WEEK-4: 16 July - 19 July
Learning about **data cleaning** through various methods, handling missing values using best applicable methods, **data curation**.

# WEEK-5: 21 July - 28 July
Final week for me. Although the project involved 6 weeks (6th one being optional :D), but due to academic demands could manage to do only the compulsory requirements.
This week involved application of all the methods learned till now into a data set that involed credit info, property, income and several other details of different customers.

# REMARKS 
The project was mainly a **learning project** and gave a good brief insight to ML and data science. The Mentors were responsive and helped with any difficulty or queries.
Overall it was a very good experience and this project would help me take the first step into ML.
